# Learning Pointcloud Distance

> ðŸš§ This repository supports an ongoing research project. Full details will be shared upon publication.

## Overview

This project explores learning-based approaches to quantify the "distance" between two point clouds. Multiple models are tested to evaluate their ability to capture meaningful geometric similarity.

## Highlights

- Predict distance between 3D point clouds  
- Modular codebase for testing different architectures  
- PyTorch implementation
